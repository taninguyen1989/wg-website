- Access from anywhere.

**Cons:**
- Innovation depends on Internet connection.

## On-Premise
**Pros:**
- Complete control over data and infrastructure.
- Works offline within the internal network.
- Suitable for industry-specific legal regulations.

**Cons:**
- High investment cost (CAPEX).
- Requires IT team for operation and maintenance.

> "The current trend is shifting strongly towards Cloud due to its flexibility and scalability."
