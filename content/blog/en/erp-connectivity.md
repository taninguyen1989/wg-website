# Seamless Data Connectivity with SAP & Epicor

Integrating **DocuWare** with leading ERP systems like **SAP**, **Epicor**, or **Microsoft Dynamics** is key to optimizing operational processes.

## Benefits of Integration
- **Bi-directional Data Synchronization**: Invoice data is pushed directly to ERP, and payment status from ERP is updated back to DocuWare.
- **Access Documents within ERP**: View original invoice images directly from the SAP/Epicor interface without switching apps.
- **Full-process Automation**: From invoice receipt to accounting and payment.

## Integration Process
1. **API Connector**: Using standard REST APIs.
2. **Data Mapping**: Mapping data fields.
3. **Validation**: Checking data validity before pushing to ERP.
